## 🔀 Fork changes (v1.0.235-fork-1)

### Heartbeat / Alive message
Publishes a periodic status message to MQTT so Home Assistant can monitor whether the HC3 bridge is alive and responsive.

- **Topic:** `homeassistant/hc3-heartbeat`
- **Interval:** configurable via QuickApp variable `heartbeatInterval` (default: 60 seconds)
- **Payload example:**
```json
{
    "status": "online",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    "uptime": 3600,
    "version": "1.0.235-fork-1",
    "devices": 42,
    "entities": 58,
    "ip": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

#### Configuring the heartbeat interval

The heartbeat interval can be configured via the QuickApp variable `heartbeatInterval` in your Fibaro HC3:

1. Open the QuickApp in your Fibaro HC3 web interface
2. Go to the **Variables** section
3. Add a new variable: name = `heartbeatInterval`, value = number of seconds (e.g. `30`, `60`, `120`)
4. Save and restart the QuickApp

If the variable is not set, the default interval of **60 seconds** is used. Lower values give faster detection of connection issues, but generate more MQTT traffic. A value of `30` is a good balance for most setups.

#### Privacy: opt out of metadata in heartbeat

By default the heartbeat payload contains the HC3's local IP, the QuickApp version, and the device/entity counts. If you don't want these published (e.g. on a shared MQTT broker), add a QuickApp variable:

| Name | Value | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| `heartbeatIncludeMeta` | `false` | Strips `version`, `devices`, `entities`, `ip` from the heartbeat payload (only `status`, `timestamp`, `uptime` remain) |

#### Heartbeat vs availability topic

This fork publishes **two** related topics:

- `homeassistant/hc3-status` — last-will availability topic, plain string `online` / `offline`. Used as the primary availability source for all bridged entities.
- `homeassistant/hc3-heartbeat` — periodic JSON heartbeat. Useful for detecting a hung QuickApp where the MQTT connection is still up but events have stopped flowing.

#### Home Assistant MQTT sensor configuration

```yaml
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "HC3 Bridge Status"
      unique_id: hc3_bridge_status
      state_topic: "homeassistant/hc3-heartbeat"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.status }}"
      json_attributes_topic: "homeassistant/hc3-heartbeat"
      json_attributes_template: "{{ value_json | tojson }}"
      icon: "mdi:bridge"

    - name: "HC3 Bridge Uptime"
      unique_id: hc3_bridge_uptime
      state_topic: "homeassistant/hc3-heartbeat"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.uptime }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "s"
      device_class: "duration"
      icon: "mdi:timer-outline"

  binary_sensor:
    - name: "HC3 Bridge Online"
      unique_id: hc3_bridge_online
      state_topic: "homeassistant/hc3-status"
      payload_on: "online"
      payload_off: "offline"
      device_class: "connectivity"
      icon: "mdi:server-network"
```

### Improved sensor device_class mapping
Based on [Eroi69's fix](https://github.com/Eroi69/hc3-to-mqtt/commit/7bc34385f753d25f70728cb290ad9747cb31fe83). The original code determined `device_class` only from the Fibaro subtype, which missed common units. This fork maps the unit of measurement to the correct Home Assistant device_class:

| Unit | device_class | state_class |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| A | current | measurement |
| V | voltage | measurement |
| W / kW | power | measurement |
| kWh / Wh | energy | total_increasing |
| °C / °F | temperature | measurement |
| lx | illuminance | measurement |
| Hz | frequency | measurement |

For ambiguous units (e.g. `%` is used by humidity, battery, position) the mapping **falls back to the device subtype** to avoid mis-classifying battery sensors as humidity. Other units not in this table also fall back to the original subtype-based logic.

## How to use

<ol>
    <li>
        Make sure you have MQTT broker installed, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/mosquitto/DOCS.md">Mosquitto within your Home Assistance instance</a>. 
        <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure you have "MQTT" integration added and configured your Home Assistant instance, as <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt">described here</a>. 
        <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Upload the Fibaro QuickApp (.fqa file) to your Fibaro Home Center 3 instance:
        <ul>
            <li>Open the Configuration Interface</li>
            <li>Go to Settings > Devices</li>
            <li>Click  +</li>
            <li>Choose Other Device</li>
            <li>Choose Upload File</li>
            <li>Choose file from your computer with .fqa</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Configure your Fibaro QuickApp:<br>
        <ul>
            <li> "<b>mqttUrl</b>" - URL for connecting to MQTT broker, e.g. <code>mqtt://192.168.1.10:1883</code> or <code>mqtts://192.168.1.10:8883</code> for TLS. <b>Use <code>mqtts://</code> whenever possible</b> — plain <code>mqtt://</code> sends username/password unencrypted over the network.</li>
            <li> "<b>mqttUsername</b>" and "<b>mqttPassword</b>" (optional) - user credentials for MQTT authentication</li>
            <li> "<b>heartbeatInterval</b>" (optional) - interval in seconds for the heartbeat message (default: 60)</li>
            <li> "<b>heartbeatIncludeMeta</b>" (optional) - set to <code>false</code> to omit IP/version/device counts from heartbeat (privacy)</li>
            <li> "<b>deviceFilter</b>" (optional) - apply your filters for Fibaro HC3 device autodiscovery in case you need to limit the number of devices to be bridged with Home Assistant. <br>
            <details>
               <summary>Click here to see example</summary>
               <code>{"filter":"baseType", "value":["com.fibaro.actor"]}, {"filter":"deviceID", "value":[41,42]}, { MORE FILTERS MAY GO HERE }</code>.<br> Fibaro Filter API description and more examples could be found at https://manuals.fibaro.com/content/other/FIBARO_System_Lua_API.pdf => "fibaro:getDevicesId(filters)"
               <br><br>Use "deviceFilter", "deviceFilter2", "deviceFilter3" ... "deviceFilterX" to overcome Fibaro QuickApp variable length limitation. Use "," (commas) after each filter criterion as it is not added added automatically
            </details>
            </li>

   * Energy and power meters
   * Charge level sensors for battery-powered devices
   * Lights - binary, dimmers and RGBW (no RGB for now)
   * Switches - binary and sound
   * Remote Controllers, where each key is binded to automation triggers visible in Home Assistant GUI
   * Thermostats (limited support for a few known vendors) 

## Building the .fqa from source

The `.fqa` is a JSON file that bundles the Lua sources together with QuickApp metadata. To rebuild it from `src/`:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_fqa.py
```

This produces `hc3_to_mqtt_bridge-1.0.235-fork-1.fqa` in the repository root, with the contents of every `src/*.lua` injected into the corresponding QuickApp file slot. The script preserves the existing QuickApp variable defaults and view layout from the previous `.fqa`. Use `--check` to verify that the committed `.fqa` is in sync with `src/` without writing.

```bash
python3 scripts/build_fqa.py --check
```

## Security considerations

- **Use TLS.** Configure `mqttUrl` with the `mqtts://` scheme and a TLS-enabled broker. Plain `mqtt://` sends credentials and device state in clear text.
- **MQTT broker authorization.** The bridge publishes device state under `homeassistant/+/+/`. Treat read access to your broker as device-state access; restrict ACLs accordingly.
- **Heartbeat metadata.** The default heartbeat reveals the HC3's local IP, QuickApp version and device counts. Set the QuickApp variable `heartbeatIncludeMeta=false` if these are sensitive in your environment.
- **Credentials in `mqttUrl`.** Avoid embedding `user:pass@` directly in `mqttUrl`. Use the dedicated `mqttUsername` / `mqttPassword` QuickApp variables — those are anonymized in logs.
- **QuickApp variables are not encrypted at rest.** Anyone with admin access to the HC3 can read them. Use a dedicated MQTT account with the minimum required ACL.
